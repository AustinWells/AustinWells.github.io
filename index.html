        I told him I had finally learned the beauty of fiber -
        bundle theory and the profound Chern - Weil theorem. 
	I said I found it amazing that gauge fields are exactly
        connections on fiber bundles, which the mathematicians 
	developed without reference to the physical world.
        I added, "this is both thrilling and puzzling, 
        since you mathematicians dreamed up these concepts 
	out of nowhere." 
        He immediately protested : "No, no. These concepts 
        were not dreamed up.They were natural and real."

            		This is my first attempt at learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory">Knot Theory</a>, and given my background Pure Math I thought it might be an interesting take to look at a different perspective, and again with my current interest in General Relativity and Physics I figured it would be a nice way to learn a little of both at the same time. This text is a very solid introduction starting off with a short crash course in differential geometry introducing manifolds, metrics, forms and the rest of the usual suspects. Motivating all this with the promise of a beautiful and simple way of expressing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations">Maxwell's Equations</a> and some modern science easy shown with these new tools. Transititiong to a crash course in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group">Lie Groups</a> and symmetries, later Curavture and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_theory">Yang-Mills Equations</a>. Finally we now get to see an introduction to Knots and a suprisingly readable one at that, not too rigorous that intuition and geometric insight are lost. The Third and Last chapter of the book covers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold">Semi-Riemannian geometry</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations">Einstein Field Equations</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Hilbert_action">Einstein-Hilbert Action</a>.

			This Classic Text known for it's clear and understandable introduction to general relativity and cosmology. The book is fairly self contained assuming only a basic undestanding of Vector Calculus. This massive volumne spanning over 1200 pages written by the popularizer of the name "Black Hole". The book introduces all the required geometry for General Relativitiy with almost 200 pages of Differential Geometry.
